# ALU_Logic1_project
4-bit unsigned ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)

Inputs:
1. Operands: Two 4-bit inputs A, B.
2. Opcode: One 4-bit input (Used to specify the operation).

Outputs:
1. 8 bits representing the output of the operation.
2. Flags for arithmetic operations:
 - The Zero flag
 - The Carry/Borrow flag (both are represented using the same bit)

- Project is implemented on Logisim.
